<h2 id=navigationfaq>How to Navigate this Website?</h2>
<p>The website is organized in the form of several "panels":
<ol>
<li>Intro
<li>Data Sources
<li>Map
<li>Dataset info
<li>Location info
<li>Graphs
<li>Data editor
</ol>
<p>You can scroll up-down between the panels, and you will notice that while you are scrolling, a "quick menu" appears on the right-hand side of the screen. You can use that menu to jump directly to given panel.
<p>Note - Data editor panel will only be available to the users who are owners of a dataset that is presented on this website, and are logged in.

<p>Panels are populated sequentially. 

<h3>Typical use case</h3>
<p> If you know what you are looking for, for example you want to view a particular variable at a particular location, say fish monitoring results at location named Chanoga, you have to:
<ol>
<li>select appropriate dataset in the Data Source panel - that will be "Fish monitoring" under "Monitoring" and "Biodiversity"
<li>upon selection of that dataset, the Dataset Info panel will be scrolled to automatically. 
<li> You may select the desired location from the list provided there OR

<li>scroll manually to Map panel and select location from the map by clicking on the appropriate marker
<li>On selecting the location you will be automatically redirected to the "Location Info panel", where you will see all Sampling Events for that location.
<li>You may then select an event you are interested in, and you will be redirected to Graphs and Data panel, where you will see the actual data.
<li>Alternatively, since this particular dataset is a monitoring dataset - you may choose to view a time series of fish data by following the "show time series" link in the Location Info panel. A time series graph will then be shown in the Graph and Data panel.
<li> After viewing data or graph (mind the graphs are interactive - explore them, please), you may go back to Location Info, or Dataset Info or Data Sources panel, and select another Event, Location or Dataset.
</ol>
<br>
<p>Access to Environmental monitoring data is organized in similar way.
<br>
<p>There are several "key" variables/locations/datasets that can be accessed by following direct links under "Key Monitoring Locations" in the Data Sources panel. 


<h2 id=downloadfaq>How to download data?</h2>
<p>Download functionality is available for all datasets. Some dataset you may download anonymously. To downlaod some datasets, you will have to register and be logged in. Registration process is easy, and we just require your name, e-mail and institutional affiliations. We will not share this information with anyone, and will not send you unsolicited e-mails.

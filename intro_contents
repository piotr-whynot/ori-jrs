The (Okavango) Monitoring and Data Sharing website provides access to environmental, ecological and biodiversity data from the Okavango Delta and the broader Okavango region.

<p>
You will find here (hopefully the most recent) results of environmental and biodiversity monitoring activities but also historical data gathered during short-term research projects in the past. This is simply a data recovery and rescue effort.

<p>
You will be able to "explore" various datasets - see what was measured, when and where, plot data in graphs and tables, and, should you wish to do so, downlodad data to perform any analyses on your computer.

<p>
This site is maintained by the staff of the Monitoring Unit of the <a class=clickable href="https://www.ori.ub.bw">Okavango Research Institute</a> of <a class=clickable href="https://www.ub.bw">the University of Botswana</a> and developed under funding from <a class=clickable href="https://jrsbiodiversity.org/grants/ori-2017/"> JRS Biodiversity Foundation</a>.
